# Constructions

Here we list some constructions that should provide meaningful testing across 
the different treebanks.

Some are specific to certain texts/authors/treebanks, some are general.

## General

* `APOS`: look for a sample of sentences with elements tagged as `APOS` in the 
AGLDT formalism.

* dative of possession, inconsistently tagged as either `OBJ` with εἶναι or `PNOM` 
(which is the correct option). It should be promoted as root, like any other 
nominal predicates.

* proleptic deictive pronouns governing an infitive clause

## Tragedy

## Homer

* `_AP` with artificial roots
